#Discuss Assignment 1

- Regarding the client location, it should be regarded as a boolean variable in the database considering its categorical and only has two options, that being 
in or out of state. This value will be compared to whatever state that we use for the database, if a user's state matches the one in the database, our variable
will return true, if not then false
- The client history should be a variable that determines if an existing customer has made at least one fuel quote, if not then we consider them a new user,
else we'll consider them a returning user.
- Gallons requested will be user input, stored as an integer, unless for the purposes of this assignment there can be non-integer values, if so we'll make it a 
floating-point value
- Company profit margin will be some sort of multiplicative value, assuming this value doesn't change, it'll be a constant, but it'll be a significant value for the
overall fuel rate
- The login feature should first, actually login the user if the information entered is stored in the database, if the information entered is incorrect/non-existent
an error message will come up to notify the user to enter the correct information]
-With regards to client profile management, users will be able to alter their information that would be important in determining their fuel quote.
-The fuel quote form and module will have the function necessary to calculate the fuel rate, with the information provided by the user. This function will return a float/double since there would be a decimal involved with the price.
- fuel quote history can be some sort stack that holds previous transactions for a user if the quote history is user-specific, if its for the entire software applicaton, we'll store it in a list.
